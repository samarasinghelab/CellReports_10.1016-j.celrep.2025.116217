The files in this folder are modified from those in Tort, Adriano BL, et al. "On the formation of gamma-coherent cell assemblies by oriens lacunosum-moleculare interneurons in the hippocampus." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 104.33 (2007): 13490-13495.


They contain the code and parameters necessary to simulate local field potentials and single-neuron raster plots corresponding to “Control” and “Mut” (DEE-13) hippocampal circuits. 


To run this code, make sure you have NEURON downloaded (https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/).


The NEURON code can be accessed and run from the Matlab file, “run_simulations.m”
